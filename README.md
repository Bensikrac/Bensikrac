- 👋 Hi, I’m @Bensikrac
- 👀 I’m interested in always learning new things
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and Rust on mediocre level (Can understand Syntax, higher level constructs missing)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple projects, need to learn how to use GitHub first.
- 📫 How to reach me: Search on the internet for my name and there will be plenty of ways.
